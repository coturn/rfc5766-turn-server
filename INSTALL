I. PLATFORMS

The TURN Server and utilities were developed and tested on Linux and FreeBSD platforms.
It may work on many other UNIXes, as well. 

II. COMPILERS

The approved compilers are gcc 4.2.1 (or better) and clang.

III. LIBRARIES AND UTILITIES

In addition to common UNIX OS services and libraries, this code requires:

1) Libevent2 IO library. 
It is assumed to be installed in /usr/local/ directory. If the location is 
different, then the Makefile has to be adjusted.

	Libevent installation instructions:
	
	*) FreeBSD:

		$ cd /usr/ports/devel/libevent2/
		$ sudo make install

		or download and install it from http://libevent.org.

	**) Linux and UNIXes: 

		Download 2.x.xx version of libevent from http://libevent.org and 
		follow the included instructions.
		
2) OpenSSL library 0.9.6 or better.

3) Pthread library.

IV. BUILD

"make" command will create bin sub-directory and put the TURN server there. 
The test applications will be located in testapps/bin/ 
sub-directory.

The supplied Makefile creates dynamically linked binaries.
If statically linked binaries are desired, then the Makefile
has to be changed, accordingly. 
 
The programs can be either called directly, or a shell scripts can be used. 
The script examples are located in scripts.examples directory.

"make clean" command will clean all results of the build process.

IV. TEST

If everything compiled properly, then the following programs must run 
together successfully:

Open threee shell screens or consoles:

In shell number 1, run peer application: 
 $ scripts.examples/peer.sh

In shell number 2, run local TURN server application:
 $ scripts.examples/secure_relay.sh

In shell number 3, run test client application:

 $ scripts.examples/secure_uclient.sh

If the client application produces output and in 20 seconds prints 
the jitter, loss and latency statistics, then everything runs fine.

Use scripts relay.sh and secure_relay.sh as guidance how to run 
the TURN server.

V. CLIENT API LIBRARY.

The compilation process will create lib/ sub-directory with libturnclient.a library. 
The header files for this library are located in include/turn/client/ sub-directory.
