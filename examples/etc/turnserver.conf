# "External" TURN Server address if the server is behind NAT.
# In the server-behind-NAT situation, only one relay address must be used, and
# that single relay address must be mapped by NAT to the 'external' IP.
# For this 'external' IP, NAT must forward ports directly (relayed port 12345
# must be always mapped to the same 'external' port 12345).
# This value, if not empty, is returned in XOR-RELAYED-ADDRESS field.
# By default, this value is empty, and the real relay IP address is used.
#

# Keys must be generated by turnadmin utility. The key value depends
# on user name, realm, and password:
#
# Example:
# $ turnadmin -k -u ninefingers -r north.gov -p youhavetoberealistic
# Output: 0xbc807ee29df3c9ffa736523fb2c4e8ee
# ('0x' in the beginning of the key is what differentiates the key from
# password. If it has 0x then it is a key, otherwise it is a password).
#
# The corresponding user account entry in the config file will be:
# 
#user=ninefingers:0xbc807ee29df3c9ffa736523fb2c4e8ee
# Or, equivalently (less secure):
#user=ninefingers:youhavetoberealistic
