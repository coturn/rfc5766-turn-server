I. General information

The directory contains the code of four TURN programs:

1) turnserver: TURN server relay.

2) uclient: asynch multiple UDP clients. (for testing purposes only !)

WARNING: the uclient program is a primitive client application. 
It does not implement the re-transmission pattern that is necessary for 
a correct TURN client implementation. In TURN, the retransmission burden 
is lying entirely on the client application.

3) peer: (for testing purposes only !) simple stateful UDP-only server, to be used as the final server 
   in relay pattern ("peer"). When clients are communicating in the client-to-client 
   pattern, this component is not needed.
   
4) stunclient: simple example of a STUN client.

These programs were developed and tested on a Linux 2.6 system (32bits Ubuntu 11.04, specifically) 
and FreeBSD 8 and 9, 32-bits and 64-bits. The tested compilers are gcc 4.2.+ and clang.

II. Third-party tools.

The relay programs are using a third-party open-source tool: the libevent2 IO library. 
It is assumed to be installed in /usr/local/ directory. If the location is different, then
the Makefile has to be adjusted.

Libevent installation instructions:

1) Linux: 

	Download 2.0.x version of libevent from http://libevent.org and follow the included instructions.
	
2) FreeBSD:

	$cd /usr/ports/devel/libevent2/
	$sudo make install

	or download and install it from http://libevent.org.

III. Build

"make" command will create bin directory. All four compiled programs are located in bin/ directory. 
The programs can be either called directly, or a shell scripts can be used. 
The script examples are located in scripts.examples directory.

"make clean" command will clean all results of the build process.

IV. Run

1) turnserver application is a TURN relay server implementation. 

The command line parameters are:

    -p      TURN listener port (Default: 3478).
    -d	    Listener interface device (optional). 
    -L      Listener IP address of relay server. Multiple listeners can be specified.
    -i	    Relay interface device for relay sockets (optional).
    -E      Relay address (the local IP address that will be used to relay the packets to the peer).		
	    Multiple relay addresses may be specified - they will be used in the round-robin manner.
    -f      set TURN fingerprints.
    -m	    number of extra threads to handle established connections.
	    The default value is 0, everything by default is handled in a single thread.
    -v      verbose.
    
2) uclient application is for test purposes only. 
It was designed to simulate multiple clients. It uses asynch IO API in 
libevent to handle multiple clients. A client connects to the relay, 
negotiates the session, and sends multiple (configured number) messages to the server (relay), 
expecting the same number of replies. The length of the messages is configurable. 
The message is an arbitrary octet stream, but it can be configured as a string. 
The number of the messages to send is configurable. 

The command-line parameters are:

	-m      number of clients (default is 1, 2 or 4, depending on options below);
	-l      message length (Default: 100 Bytes);
	-p      TURN server port (Default: 3478);
	-n      number of messages to send (Default: 5);
	-d      local interface device (optional);
	-L      local IP address (optional);
	-v      verbose;
	-s      use "send" method in TURN; by default, it uses TURN "channels".
	-y      use client-to-client connections: 
	    	RTP/RTCP pair of channels to another RTP/RTCP pair of channels;
	    	with this option the peer application is not used,
	    	as the relay endpoints are talking to each other; 
	-h      hang on indefinitely after the last sent packet;
	-e      peer address;
	-r      peer port (default 3479);
	-c      do not create rtcp connections;
	-x      request IPv6 relayed address (RFC6156);
	-g      set DONT_FRAGMENT parameter in TURN requests;
    
3) peer application is a simple UDP-only echo backend server. This application
is used for the test purposes only, as a 'peer' for the uclient application. 

The command line parameters are:

    -p      UDP listening port (Default: 3479). 
    -d	    local interface device (optional)
    -L      local address of peer server
    -v      verbose

4) stunclient is a basic STUN client. It sends a STUN request and shows the reply information.

Usage: stunclient [options] <IP-address>

The command line parameters are:

    -p      remote port (Default: 3478). 
    -L      local address.
