I. General information

This directory contains the source code of five TURN-related programs:

1) turnserver: TURN server relay. 
The compiled binary image of this program is located in bin/ sub-directory.

2) turnadmin: TURN administration tool.
This tool can be used to generate TURN keys.

3) uclient: asynch multiple UDP clients. (for testing purposes only !)
The compiled binary image of this program is located in testapps/bin/ sub-directory.

WARNING: the uclient program is a primitive client application. 
It does not implement the re-transmission pattern that is necessary for 
a correct TURN client implementation. In TURN, the retransmission burden 
is lying entirely on the client application.

4) peer: (for testing purposes only !) a simple stateless UDP-only "echo" server, 
	to be used as the final server in relay pattern ("peer"). When clients are 
	communicating in the client-to-client manner, this component is not needed.
	
The compiled binary image of this program is located in testapps/bin/ subdirectory.
   
5) stunclient: a simple STUN client example.
The compiled binary image of this program is located in testapps/bin/ subdirectory.

These programs were developed and tested on a Linux 2.6 system (32bits Ubuntu 11.04, specifically) 
and FreeBSD 8 and 9, 32-bits and 64-bits. The tested compilers are gcc 4.2.+ and clang.
  
II. Tools and libraries.

The relay programs are using a third-party open-source tool: the libevent2 IO library. 
It is assumed to be installed in /usr/local/ directory. If the location is different, then
the Makefile has to be adjusted.

Libevent installation instructions:

1) Linux: 

	Download 2.0.x version of libevent from http://libevent.org and follow the included instructions.
	
2) FreeBSD:

	$cd /usr/ports/devel/libevent2/
	$sudo make install

	or download and install it from http://libevent.org.
	
TURN Server also uses openssl library - for MD5 and HMAC-SHA1.

TURN Server uses pthread library for multithreading. 

III. Build

"make" command will create bin sub-directory and put the TURN server there. 
The test applications will be located in testapps/bin/ 
sub-directory.
 
The programs can be either called directly, or a shell scripts can be used. 
The script examples are located in scripts.examples directory.

"make clean" command will clean all results of the build process.

IV. Client API library.

The compilation process will create lib/ sub-directory with libturnclient.a library. 
The header files for this library are located in include/turn/client/ sub-directory.

V. Run

1) turnserver application is a TURN relay server implementation. 

The command line parameters are:

	-d, --listening-device	Listener interface device (optional, Linux only).
	-p, --listening-port	TURN listener port (Default: 3478).
	-L, --listening-ip		Listener IP address of relay server. Multiple listeners can be specified.
							If no IP(s) specified, then all IPv4 and IPv6 system IPs will be used
							for listening.
	-i, --relay-device		Relay interface device for relay sockets (optional, Linux only).
	-E, --relay-ip			Relay address (the local IP address that will be used to relay the packets to the peer).
							Multiple relay addresses may be used.
							If no relay IP(s) specified, then all non-loopback system Ips will be used.
	-m, --relay-threads		number of extra threads to handle the established connections.
							By default, everything in handled in single thread 
							(the default number of extra threads is 0).
	-l, --min-port			Lower bound of the UDP port range for relay endpoints allocation.
							Default value is 49152, according to RFC 5766.
	-r, --max-port			Upper bound of the UDP port range for relay endpoints allocation.
							Default value is 65535, according to RFC 5766.
	-v, --verbose			Verbose.
	-f, --fingerprint		Use fingerprints in the TURN messages.
	-a, --lt-cred-mech		Use long-term credential mechanism.
	-u, --user				User account, in the column-separated form 'username:key'.
							The key is generated by bin/turnadmin command.
							The key is calculated over the user name, the realm, 
							and the user password.
	-e, --realm				Realm.
	-q, --user-quota		per-user allocation quota.
	-Q, --total-quota		total allocation quota.
	-c						Configuration file name (default - turn.conf).
							The format of config file can be seen in the supplied etc/turn.conf 
							example file. Long names of the options are used as the configuration items
							names in the file.  
							If not absolute path is supplied, then the file is searched first in the
							current directory, then in ./etc, then in /etc, then in /usr/local/etc.
	-n						Do not use configuration file.
	-h						help.
	
2) turnadmin application is a TURN relay administration tool. 

Usage:

Generate a key:
$ turnadmin -k -u <username> -r <realm> -p <password>

Add/update a user (and realm) in the config file:
$ turnadmin -a [-c <config-file>] -u <username> -r <realm> -p <password>

Delete a user from the config file:
$ turnadmin -d [-c <config-file>] -u <username>

Help:
$ turnadmin -h  

The command line parameters are:

	-k, --key			Command: generate key for a user.
	-a, --add       	Command: add or update a user.
	-d, --delete		Command: delete a user.
	-c, --config-file 	Configuration file.
	-u, --user			User name.
	-r, --realm			Realm.
	-p, --password		Password.
	-h, --help			Help.
    
3) uclient application is for test purposes only. 
It was designed to simulate multiple clients. It uses asynch IO API in 
libevent to handle multiple clients. A client connects to the relay, 
negotiates the session, and sends multiple (configured number) messages to the server (relay), 
expecting the same number of replies. The length of the messages is configurable. 
The message is an arbitrary octet stream, but it can be configured as a string. 
The number of the messages to send is configurable. 

The command-line parameters are:

	-m      number of clients (default is 1, 2 or 4, depending on options below);
	-l      message length (Default: 100 Bytes);
	-p      TURN server port (Default: 3478);
	-n      number of messages to send (Default: 5);
	-d      local interface device (optional);
	-L      local IP address (optional);
	-v      verbose;
	-s      use "send" method in TURN; by default, it uses TURN "channels".
	-y      use client-to-client connections: 
	    	RTP/RTCP pair of channels to another RTP/RTCP pair of channels;
	    	with this option the peer application is not used,
	    	as the relay endpoints are talking to each other; 
	-h      hang on indefinitely after the last sent packet;
	-e      peer address;
	-r      peer port (default 3479);
	-c      do not create rtcp connections;
	-x      request IPv6 relayed address (RFC6156);
	-g      set DONT_FRAGMENT parameter in TURN requests;
    
4) peer application is a simple UDP-only echo backend server. This application
is used for the test purposes only, as a 'peer' for the uclient application. 

The command line parameters are:

    -p      Listening UDP port (Default: 3479). 
    -d	    Listening interface device (optional)
    -L      Listening address of peer server
    -v      verbose

5) stunclient is a basic STUN client. It sends a STUN request and shows the reply information.

Usage: stunclient [options] <IP-address>

The command line parameters are:

    -p      STUN server port (Default: 3478). 
    -L      local address to use (optional).
