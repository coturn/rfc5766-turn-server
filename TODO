==================================================================

###   I. PLATFORMS SUPPORT   ###

==================================================================

1) Fedora package.

2) DTLS support for Cygwin.

3) MS Windows support.

	Cygwin is supported. A "real" MS-Windows port would 
	involve a usable GUI.
	
4) Debian submission upgrade.

5) FreeBSD submission upgrade.

==================================================================

###   II. DOCS   ###

==================================================================

1) User's manual.

2) Developer's manual.

3) Structure Wiki into sections.

==================================================================

###   III. NETWORK ENGINE   ###

==================================================================

1) Multiple authentication servers, each in a separate thread

2) For listening endpoints, flexible format like IP:port.

==================================================================

###   IV. PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION   ###

==================================================================

1) A smarter load balancer has to be implemented.
 
	The load balancer has to have a heartbeat channels with 
	the slave servers, currently it is only just a dumb 
	round-robin load distributor.

2) For a large enterprise, a user-space stack to be integrated.

	An another socket abstraction to be implemented, 
	the one that uses the user-space TCP/IP stack with 
	zero memory copy. This is an ambitious goal that would 
	increase the system scaleability, significantly. 
	The stock TCP/IP stack in UNIX and in MS Windows do not 
	scale gracefully. We are trying to suppress those issues 
	in the TURN Server, by using an advanced synchronous 
	I/O technique, but still the underlying stock TCP/IP stack 
	is a limitation.  

==================================================================

###   V. SECURITY   ###

==================================================================

1) RADIUS integration ?

2) Add SHA256 security.

	SHA1 is mandatory according to RFC5766. But it would be 
	nice to have SHA256, as an option. I guess that for some 
	applications the additional CPU load can be justified.

==================================================================

###   VI. STANDARDS SUPPORT   ###

==================================================================

1) Follow the draft ICE endpoint mobility standard and implement 
it if it is accepted:

   http://tools.ietf.org/id/draft-wing-mmusic-ice-mobility-04.html#rfc.section.5.1

2) For extra difficult NAT/FWs, consider implementing Websockets.

==================================================================

###   VII. MISC FEATURES   ###

==================================================================


1) Locale support (?).

	Currently we assume that all text data is 8-bits encoded, 
	like C locale. It would be nice to support localized 
	strings (8-bits and 2-bytes as well). But I am not sure 
	whether this is really important, given the essentially
	backend nature of the TURN Server. The TURN server is so 
	deeply "hidden" in the network infrastructure that the 
	significant code complication 

2) HTTP or GUI status monitor and management.

	For enterprise users, a management (configuration, status 
	and statistics) GUI has to be implemented. Currently, all 
	these features are available through the shell command 
	line and through Redis command line.

	Also, Redis status data to be extended.

3) Traffic recording (for selected allocations).

	That would be a helpful feature for a large enterprise 
	(for testing and security purposes). 

==================================================================

###   VIII. CODING STUFF   ###

==================================================================

1) Remove C++ compilation warnings in Solaris.
