Things to be added:

1) Locale support (?).
2) User manual.
3) Developer manual.
4) MS Windows support.
5) HTTP status monitor and management.
6) Add SHA256 security.

More details:

1) Another socket abstraction implementation has to be added, one compatible with MS Windows platform. Due to the flaw in MS Windows network layer, UDP sockets do not work properly in the TURN server, and a workaround must be implemented. After that, the TURN server will be working fine under Cygwin. Now, only TCP feature works fine in Cygwin.

2) After that, a native MS Windows implementation can be considered. It would involve a good GUI for MS Windows users.

3) For enterprise users, a management (configuration, status and statistics) GUI has to be implemented. Currently, all these features are available through the command line and through Redis.

4) A smarter load balancer has to be implemented. The load balancer has to have a heartbeat channel with the slave servers, currently it is just a dumb round-robin load distributor.

5) For a large enterprise, another socket abstraction to be implemented, for user-space TCP/IP stack with zero memory copy. This is an ambitious goal that would increase the scalability significantly.

6) traffic recording also would be a helpful feature for a large enterprise (for testing and security purposes).
