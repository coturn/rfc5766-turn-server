TURN(8 Jan 2013)	

== GENERAL INFORMATION ==

       The  *TURN Server* project contains the source code of a TURN server and
       TURN client messaging library. Also, some extra programs	provided,  for
       testing-only purposes.

       See the INSTALL file for	the building instructions.

       After the build,	you will have the following binary images:

 *     _*turnserver*_:  *TURN Server* relay. The compiled binary image of this program is located in bin/ sub-directory.
 *     _*turnadmin*_: TURN administration tool. This tool can be used to generate	TURN keys for the user accounts. For security reasons, we do not recommend storing passwords openly. The better	option is to use pre-processed "keys" which are then used for authentication. These keys are generated by _turnadmin_.
 *     _*uclient*_: emulates multiple UDP,TCP,TLS or DTLS  clients. The compiled binary image of this program is located in examples/bin/ sub-directory.
{{{
       WARNING:	the uclient program is a primitive client application and 
       is provided for test-only purposes.  
       It does not implement the re-transmission pattern that is necessary for a
       correct	TURN client implementation. In TURN, the retransmission	burden
       is lying	entirely on the	client application. We provide	the  messaging
       functionality  in the client library, but the client must implement the
       correct Networking IO processing	in the client program code.
}}}
 *	_*peer*_: a simple stateless UDP-only "echo" server, to be used as the final server in relay pattern ("_peer_"). For every incoming UDP packet, it simply echoes it back.  (this program is provided for the testing purposes only !)	When the test clients are communicating in the	client-to-client manner, this component	is not needed. The compiled binary image of this program is located in examples/bin/ subdirectory.
 *	_*stunclient*_: a simple STUN	client example.	 The  compiled	binary image of this program is located in examples/bin/ subdirectory.

       In the "examples/scripts"	subdirectory, you will find the	 examples  of  command
       lines to	be used	to run the programs. The scripts are meant to be run from examples/ subdirectory:
{{{
	$ cd examples
	$ ./scripts/secure_relay.sh
}}}

== RUN ==

===turnserver application: a TURN relay server implementation===

====Usage:====
{{{
       $ turnserver [-vfao] [-n | -c <config-file>] [-b <user-db-file> | --userdb=<user-db-file>] [options]
       $ turnserver -h
}}}

====Flags:====

   * *-v,* *--verbose* Verbose.
   * *-o,* *--daemon* Run server process as daemon.
   * *-f,* *--fingerprint* Use fingerprints in the TURN messages.
   * *-a,* *--lt-cred-mech* Use long-term credential mechanism. By default, no credential mechanism is used - any user is allowed.
   * *-h*  Help.

====Config file setting:====

   * *-n*     Do not use configuration file, use only command line parameters.
   * *-c*     Configuration file name (default - turnserver.conf).  The	format of  config  file can be seen in the supplied examples/etc/turnserver.conf example file. Long names of the options are used as the configuration  items names in the file. If not an absolute path is supplied, then the file is searched in the following	directories:
	      *	 current directory
	      *	 current directory etc/	subdirectory
	      *	 upper directory level etc/
	      *	 /etc/
	      *	 /usr/local/etc/
   * *-b,* *--userdb*
	      'Dynamic'	user database file name	(default  -  turnuserdb.conf).
	      This  user  database  is	being  dynamically  checked  while the
	      _turnserver_ is working, and the  user  accounts  can  be  changed
	      dynamically by editing the file.

====Options:====

    *   *-d,* *--listening-device* Listener interface device (optional functionality, Linux only). The turnserver process must have root privileges to bind the	listening endpoint to a device. If turnserver must run as a	process without root privileges, then just do not use this setting.
    *   *-p,* *--listening-port* TURN listener port for UDP and TCP listeners (Default: 3478).
    *   *--tls-listening-port*   TURN listener port for TLS and DTLS listeners (Default: 5349).
    *   *-L,* *--listening-ip* Listener IP address of relay server.  Multiple listeners can  be specified.  If no *IP*(s) specified, then all IPv4 and IPv6 system IPs will be used for listening.
    *   *-i,* *--relay-device* Relay interface device for relay sockets (optional, Linux	only).
    *   *-E,* *--relay-ip* Relay  address  (the local IP address that will be used to relay the packets to the _peer_).	Multiple relay addresses may be	 used. If  no  relay  *IP*(s) specified, then all non-loopback system IPs will be used.
    *   *-m,* *--relay-threads* Number of	extra threads to handle	the  established  connections. By  default, everything in handled in single thread (the default number of	extra threads is 0).
    *   *--min-port* Lower bound of the UDP port range	for  relay  endpoints  allocation.  Default value is 49152, according to RFC 5766.
    *   *--max-port* Upper  bound  of	the UDP	port range for relay endpoints allocation.  Default value is 65535, according to RFC 5766.
    *   *-u,* *--user* User account, in the column-separated form 'username:key'. The key is either the	user password, or the key is generated by _turnadmin_ command. In the second case, the key  must be  prepended with  '0x'  symbols. The key is calculated over the user name, the realm, and the user password.
    *   *-r,* *--realm* Realm to be used for all users.
    *   *-q,* *--user-quota* Per-user allocation quota.
    *   *-Q,* *--total-quota* total allocation quota.
    *	*-s,* *--max-bps* Max bytes-per-second bandwidth a TURN session is allowed to handle (input and output network streams combined). Anything above that limit will be dropped.
    *   *--cert* Certificate file, PEM format. Same file search rules applied  as for the configuration file. If both *--no-tls* and *--no-dtls* options are specified, then this parameter is not needed.
    *   *--pkey* Private key file, PEM format. Same file search rules applied as for the configuration file. If both *--no-tls* and *--no-dtls* options are specified, then this parameter is not needed.
    *   *--no-udp* Do not start 'plain' UDP listeners.
    *   *--no-tcp* Do not start 'plain'TCP listeners.
    *   *--no-tls* Do not start TLS listeners.

=== uclient application (for test purposes only)===
  It was designed to simulate multiple clients. It uses asynch IO API in  libevent to  handle  multiple  clients. A  client connects to the relay, negotiates the session, and sends	multiple  (configured  number) messages	to  the	 server	 (relay), expecting the	same number of replies. The length of the messages is configurable.   The  message is an arbitrary octet stream, but it	can be configured as a string.  The number of the messages to send is configurable.

====Usage:====
{{{
       $ uclient [-tSvsyhcxg] [options]	<TURN-Server-IP-address>
}}}
====Flags:====

 *      *-t*     Use TCP (default is UDP).
 *      *-S*     Secure connection: TLS for TCP, DTLS for UDP.
 *      *-v*     Verbose.
 *      *-s*     Use "send" method	in TURN; by default, it	uses TURN  "channels".
 *      *-y*     Use  client-to-client  connections: RTP/RTCP pair	of channels to another RTP/RTCP pair of channels.  with this  option  the  _peer_ application  is  not used, as the relay endpoints	are talking to each other.
 *      *-h*     Hang on indefinitely after the last sent packet.
 *      *-c*     Do not create rtcp connections.
 *      *-x*     Request IPv6 relayed address (RFC6156).
 *      *-g*     Set DONT_FRAGMENT	parameter in TURN requests.

====Options:====

 *      *-l*     Message length (Default: 100 Bytes).
 *      *-i*     Certificate file (for secure connections only).
 *      *-k*     Private key file (for secure connections only).
 *      *-p*     *TURN* *Server* port (Default: 3478 unsecure,	5349 secure).
 *      *-n*     Number of	messages to send (Default: 5).
 *      *-d*     Local interface device (optional).
 *      *-L*     Local IP address (optional).
 *      *-m*     Number of	clients	(default is 1, 2 or 4,	depending  on  options below).
 *      *-e*     Peer address.
 *      *-r*     Peer port	(default 3479).

       See the _uclient_ usage examples	in the "examples/scripts" directory.

=== peer  application (for test purposes ony) ===
Peer a simple UDP-only echo backend server. This application is used for the test purposes only, as a '_peer_'  for the _uclient_ application.

====Usage:====
{{{
       $ peer [-v] [options]
}}}
====Options:====

 *      *-p*     Listening	UDP port (Default: 3479).
 *      *-d*     Listening	interface device (optional)
 *      *-L*     Listening	address	of _peer_	server. Multiple listening addresses can be used, IPv4 and IPv6.
 *      *-v*     Verbose

=== stunclient is a basic STUN client ===
It sends a STUN request and shows the	reply information.

====Usage:====
{{{
       $ stunclient [options] <STUN-Server-IP-address>
}}}
====Options:====

 *      *-p*     STUN server port (Default: 3478).
 *      *-L*     Local address to use (optional).

== LIBRARIES ==

       In the lib/ sub-directory the build process  will  create  TURN	client
       messaging  library.   In	 the  include/	sub-directory,	the  necessary
       include files will be placed.

== LOGS ==

When the *TURN Server* starts, it makes efforts to create a log file {{{turnserver_<pid>.log}}} 
in the following directories:

	* /var/log
	* /log/
	* /var/tmp
	* /tmp
	* current directory

If all efforts failed (due to the system permission settings) then all 
log messages are sent only to the standard output of the process.
