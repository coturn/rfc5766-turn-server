I. PLATFORMS

The TURN Server and utilities were developed and tested on Linux, FreeBSD and
Solaris 11 platforms. Both 32 bits and 64 bits variants tested.

It may work on many other UNIXes, as well. The build.sh script and/or 
Makefile may need adjustments for other UNIXes.

II. COMPILERS

The approved compilers are gcc 4.2.1 (or better) and clang. But it may work 
with others compilers, too.

III. EXTRA LIBRARIES AND UTILITIES

In addition to common UNIX OS services and libraries, this code requires:

1) Libevent2 IO library. 
It is assumed to be installed in /usr/local/ directory. By default,
Libevent2 installs itself in that directory. If the location is 
different, then the Makefile has to be adjusted.

	Libevent installation instructions:
	
	*) FreeBSD:

		$ cd /usr/ports/devel/libevent2/
		$ sudo make install

		or download and install it from http://libevent.org.

	**) Linux and UNIXes: 

		Download 2.x.xx version of libevent from http://libevent.org and 
		follow the supplied instructions. The instructions are fairly
		standard (./configure and make install).
		
2) OpenSSL library 0.9.6 or better.

3) Pthread library.

IV. BUILD

build.sh script will create bin sub-directory and put the TURN server there. 
The test applications will be located in testapps/bin/ 
sub-directory.

For most platforms, just "make" would suffice.

The supplied Makefile creates dynamically linked binaries.
If statically linked binaries are desired, then the Makefile
has to be changed, accordingly. 
 
The programs can be either called directly, or a shell scripts can be used. 
The script examples are located in scripts.examples directory.

"make clean" command will clean all results of the build process.

IV. TEST

If everything compiled properly, then the following programs must run 
together successfully, simulating TURN processing in local networking 
environment:

Open three shell screens or consoles:

In shell number 1, run peer application: 
 $ scripts.examples/peer.sh

In shell number 2, run local TURN server application:
 $ scripts.examples/secure_relay.sh

In shell number 3, run test client application:

 $ scripts.examples/secure_uclient.sh

If the client application produces output and in 22 seconds prints 
the jitter, loss and latency statistics, then everything runs fine.

Use scripts relay.sh and secure_relay.sh as guidance how to run 
the TURN server.

V. CLIENT API LIBRARY.

The compilation process will create lib/ sub-directory with libturnclient.a library. 
The header files for this library are located in include/turn/client/ sub-directory.
